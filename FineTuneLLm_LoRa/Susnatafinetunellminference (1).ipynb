            "\n",
            "1. **Water droplets in the air**: When it rains, water droplets form in the atmosphere, typically in clouds. These droplets are suspended in the air and are usually small, ranging from a few micrometers to a few millimeters in diameter.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Scattering of light**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these water droplets. The droplets scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Blue light scattering**: The blue light is scattered away from the direct path, making the sky appear blue. However, when the sun is low on the horizon (e.g., during sunrise or sunset), the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered even more, making the sky appear more blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Rain and cloud formation**: Rain is formed when the water droplets in clouds become heavy enough to fall to the ground. The droplets are usually larger than those in the clear sky, which means they scatter light more effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Grey sky**: When the rain is heavy, the water droplets are so numerous that they cover the entire sky, scattering all wavelengths of light equally. This scattering effect is similar to the Rayleigh scattering that occurs in the clear sky, but with a much higher density of water droplets. As a result, the sky appears grey, as the blue light is scattered in all directions, and the red light is scattered less, allowing the grey color to dominate.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the grey sky on a rainy day is a result of the scattering of light by numerous water droplets in the atmosphere, which is similar to the scattering effect that occurs in the clear sky but with a much higher density of droplets.\n"
